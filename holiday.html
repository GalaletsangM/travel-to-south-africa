            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              Hi, my name is Precious, and I'm from North West, South Africa. I have passion for both 
              coding and traveling. My travels have taken me to various countries, including the United States,
              Dubai, Qatar, and the Dominican Republic, with many more destinations on my list. I'm always eager to 
              explore more of what this beautiful world has to offer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I created this page to provide helpful guidance for those planning their first trip to South Africa.
              Here you'll find insights into the must-see attraction across all nine provinces, curated from my 
              experiences and love for my home country.
