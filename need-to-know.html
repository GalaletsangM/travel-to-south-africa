          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Hi, my name is Precious, and I'm from North West, South Africa. I
            have passion for both coding and traveling. My travels have taken me
            to various countries, including the United States, Dubai, Qatar, and
            the Dominican Republic, with many more destinations on my list. I'm
            always eager to explore more of what this beautiful world has to
            offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created this page to provide helpful guidance for those planning
            their first trip to South Africa. Here you'll find insights into the
            must-see attraction across all nine provinces, curated from my
            experiences and love for my home country.

            of my work but also as a helpful resource for travelers exploring
            South Africa's incredible destinations.
